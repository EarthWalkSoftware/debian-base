# EarthWalkSoftware/debian-base

*EarthWalkSoftware/debian-base* is a version of the [nimmis/docker-ubuntu](https://github.com/nimmis/docker-ubuntu) docker image modified for use with *Debian 9*.  It adds several system utilities and libraries that are nominally required to properly utilize the *library/debian* docker image, and adds system initialization and supervisor functions for better control.  

A pre-made docker image of *earthwalksoftware/debian-base* is available from [EarthWalkSoftware](https://hub.docker.com/r/earthwalksoftware/debian-base/) at https://hub.docker.com/r/earthwalksoftware/debian-base/
